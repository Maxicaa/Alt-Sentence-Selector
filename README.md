 # 1. What does the extension do ?
 
 Alt-Sentence-Selector is an extension for Chrome and Edge allowing you to select a specific sentence in a text by clicking on it while holding down the ALT key.

This can be useful if you frequently copy texts from website in your mails or documents (e.g. quote from a text, extract of a section of a law, etc).

# 2. Installation

The extension can be download and installed from the [Chrome Webstore](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/alt-sentence-selector/knnghjjfdabamneliapcjdllobjfghmd).

To finish the installation, you may need to restart your browser to make it work.

# 3. How to use it ?

Just maintain the ALT key when clicking on a sentence to select it. 

Some texts are not currently supported depending how the text is formatted. For example, as the extension does not yet recognize a carriage return in a youtube comment, clicking on a first sentence of a paragraph will also select the last sentence of the previous paragraph.

# 4. Q & A

## Does this extension collect any data on my utilization ?

No, the extension read the page in the sole purpose to determine the beginning and the end of the sentence the user wish to select. No data is collected or communicated in any circumstances by the extension.
